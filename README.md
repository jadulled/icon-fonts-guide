# Icon fonts guide (WIP)

This brief document seeks to optimize the use of icons, make easier their implementation and improve the performance of each project. Its main goal is that each project uses only the icons that they really need. 

Following this goal, the icon library was reviewed and three different packages were arranged: 

####1. Full package

Includes all the icons that we use in MercadoLibre. Most of them are courtesy of [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) however are a few exceptions: 

- "icon-user" and "icon-users" are from "MFG Labs" library. You can get in Fontello. 
- "icon-offical-store", "icon-card", "icon-cash", "icon-motorcycle" and "icon-trash" are custom so you must include their corresponding svg file. To do this, simple drag and drop your files into the browser when you are using [Fontello](http://www.fontello.com). 

You can download the full package from (…) 

####2. Component package

Includes only the icons that a particular component need. Eg. Header or footer. 

You can download packages from (…) 

###3. Custom package

Includes only the icons that a particular project needs. You can create your own package following this simple steps: 

- Go to [Fontello](http://www.fontello.com)
- Choose the icons you need from the list or include your own svg files. 
- Name your front from the upper right corner of the browser. 
- If you included custom svg files, remember to name them from the "Customize names" tab.
- In "Customize codes" setup your characters codes. 
- Finally, **download** your font and include it to your project.
